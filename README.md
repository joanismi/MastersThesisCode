Code to reproduce methods &amp; results from my Master's Thesis Project.
I will add a link to the final document as soon as it is officially published.

To reproduce this project just clone or download this repository and create a Python virtual environment.
To learn how to create a virtual environment refer to [creating a virtual environment](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#creating-a-virtual-environment).

If you use our data or analysis in your research, please cite us!

## System Requirements
Our code was run using the following software:
- Python version 3.10.12
- R version 4.1.2

#### Python packages to install:
See requirements.txt

To install all packages using this file just type
```
pip install requirements.txt
```
inside your python virtual environment

#### R packages to install:

## Analysis notebooks:
The notebooks in the `src` directory can be used to generate the data required to create all figures in present in the thesis:
- 1_gene_expression_analysis.ipynb: this notebook covers Methods section 2.2 and Results section 3.1.
- 2_organotropism_pairs.ipynb: this notebook covers Methods section 2.6 and Results section 3.2.
